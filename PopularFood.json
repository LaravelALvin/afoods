      "description": "Most of the best Filipino homemade recipes have one common denominator, and it is the presence of a flavorful, rich and steaming hot stew. Perhaps the love for dishes with some protein sitting in a pool of the most mouthwatering savory sauce comes from the natural warmth it brings to the dining table. And for Humba, the same appeal stands, as it is served warm, and with all the wondrous flavors of banana blossoms, soy sauce, and vinegar. Humba utilizes the warm, tender texture of braised pork, and is often likened to another Filipino fan favorite, which is adobo. However, this dish is particularly known for its sweeter take on braised pork, as compared to the sour, flavorful adobo. This recipe actually originated in the Visayas region, and later evolved into a dish with comparably less sweet ingredients. But if you are looking to taste the Bisaya version, which utilizes clear soft drinks instead of pineapple juice, then I’ve got what you’re looking for. This rendition has some mightily delicious regional flavors, and makes the most of the blend of sweet and savory for a delightful pork stew. Let’s make the Bisaya rendition of this braised pork classic!",
