      "description": "Adobo can be considered as the most popular dish out of all the Philippines food, and it is definitely loved by everyone — westerners’ palate included. In fact, it can even be considered as the ‘national dish’ of the country! The most common type of adobo uses chicken or pork meat and it is first marinated in garlic, black peppercorns, bay leaves, soy sauce, and vinegar. After some time, it will be browned in oil and then simmered to goodness in its marinade. Pair it off with some good ol’ rice and you’re bound to have it as your new favorite viand!",
